# Youtube clone - CI/CD Pipeline üöÄ

This project focuses on implementing a Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline using Jenkins. The goal is to deploy a clone of the YouTube application to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) while incorporating security vulnerability scanning with Trivy. The pipeline also integrates SonarQube for static code analysis and quality gate checks.
